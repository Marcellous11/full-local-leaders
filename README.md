## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Marcellous11/capstone2-Local-Leaders.git
```

You'll need to open threww terminal windows and cd into both backend, frontend, and server. Make sure you have a database server ( I used postresSQL) running on port 5432. You will also need to run the file "leaders.sql" in a psql PostgreSQL interactive console. Run this in your termial

```bash
  pqsl
```
 Then run this to create database and fill it with starter code. 
```bash
  \i leaders.sql
```


Backend

```bash
  cd local-leaders-back-end
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm start
```
Next you have to create a free google account at [Google developer](https://developers.google.com/) and create a API TOKEN, also free. 
In the apis folder, you will need to create a secret folder with a secret.js file in it.  Save your API TOKEN in the secret.js file and export it.

Frontend

```bash
  cd local-leaders-front-end
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  npm install
```

Start the server

```bash
  npm start
```
